# SmartThings - Ring Alarm Device & Smart-App

:mega: **DEPRECATED:** All features from this fork have been merged back to the original repository: https://github.com/asishrs/smartthings

> :mega: This is a fork of https://github.com/asishrs/smartthings adding support for sensors as "Things" that can be used in automation tasks.

This repository contains device handler and smart-app for Ring Alarm integration with SmartThings. In order to use this, you need to deploy the API part as described [here](https://github.com/asishrs/smartthings-ringalarmv2 ).

## Prerequisites 
[Ring Alarm API](https://github.com/asishrs/smartthings-ringalarmv2 ) 

 :warning:You need to have a working API before proceed to the next steps.

## Supported Ring Devices

- Keypad
- Motion sensor
- Contact sensor
- Flood/freeze sensor
- Z-Wave range extender
